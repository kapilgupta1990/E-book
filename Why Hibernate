5 reasons:

1. Automatic conversion from Object to Tuple and vice versa
In simple JDBC -> what you do -> you query to a table -> You get the result set -> then you map it to corresponsing object
Same case while persist : -> Object -> SQL Map ->  then save
Hibernate saves this time to automatically conversion of object to tuple and tuple to object.

2. Simple JDBC : queries are database depedent , using Hibernate queries are database indepedent.

3. Automatic schema creation for you, you write the class , map it into hibernate.cfg.xml

4. Support of caching (In database you have to write your own code for cachinh)

5. Development time very less
