JMS (Java messaging service ) v/s AMQP(Advanced messaging queue protocol)

1. JMS was originally designed to for delivering message from one java application to another java application, whereac AMQP 
was designed for cross platform message transfer (Like from Java to Ruby)

2. As JMS API was developed by java community , keeping in mind how two java application can communicate. There are 
  multiple vendors that implement this JMS API.
   Couple for Vendors:
     -- Active MQ, Hornet MQ and SOnic MQ
     
 3. There are 5 message types supported by JMS (Object, Map , Byte , Text , Stream) while AMQP only supports Byte message Type.
 
 4. Using AMQP it is possible to send message between Java and Ruby.
 
 5. In JMS you send message directly to either to topic/queue but in case of AMQP client sends a message to exchange, and it is 
 the responsiblity of client in AMQP to bind that queue with exchange.
